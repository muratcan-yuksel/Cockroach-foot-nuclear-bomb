Beware in front of the game : Cockroach, foot, nuclear-bomb!

It's a derivative from the well known rock-paper-scissors, made famous by the legendary tv series That 70's Show. You can find the clip here in which Hyde hilariously explains the game to Fez https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRi2j8k0vjo

The rules aree pretty straightforward:

Foot squishes cockroach

Nuclear bomb destroys the foot

Cockroach survives the nuclear bomb
